## ðŸš€ Features
- EDA on SMS Spam Collection Dataset
- CountVectorizer for text feature extraction
- Logistic Regression for classification
- Custom message prediction
- Model saving and loading

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included
- `spam_classifier_model.pkl`: Trained Logistic Regression model
- `spam_vectorizer.pkl`: Fitted CountVectorizer
- `spam_classifier.ipynb`: Colab notebook with all code and explanations

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- [UCI SMS Spam Collection](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection)

## âœ¨ Try It Yourself
Load the model and vectorizer, and predict new messages like:
```python

vec = vectorizer.transform(msg)
model.predict(vec)  # [1] means spam
